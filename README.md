# PrayerTimesWeb

This code is used in Sunni Manzil Adkar app, to fetch location based prayer times. We used jQuery to do some simple tasks. Code to solve the issues of ```xhr ``` is also included in the index file. 
* Users need to provide the location permission to work perfectly.
* Users can change the calculation methods.
* Methods will be autosaved to ```localStorage``` *(You may use ```sessionStorage``` instead).* So whenever the user revisits the page, previously  selected method will be fetched.
* API responses are received from https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api
